Nasr_Design_and_Implementation:
1. Archetecture:
	Architectural design 
		-database 
			-Two tables, containing all necessary info
		-functions
			-each class has their own functions listed in step 1
		-classes
			-Student, admin, instructor
		-user interface
			-Login Screen, into menu with given options, different options lead to different 
			images/secondary options
	Interface design 
		attempt a graphical model, simple design with button like selections
	Component design 
		- menu layout can be reused in multiple sections
		-Subclasses:
		-Students are able to: 
			-search courses 
			-add/drop courses 
			-print their schedule
		-The Instructor subclass:
			-Instructor classes can:
			-print their schedule 
			-print their classlist
			-search for courses.
		-The Admin subclass:
			-Admin classes can:
			-add courses to the system
			-remove coursesfrom the system
			-add/remove users 
			-add/remove student from a course
			-search and print rosters and courses.
	Database design 
		I beileive two tables are sufficent as all users have the same basic info, 
		the 1st table would contain:
			Columns: ID, name, and user type(admin, instructor, user)
		the 2nd table would be user specific, storing/displaying their current schedule
2. Validation
	-Test Each component indiviually
	-Intergrate components together 
	-test the collective components
	-apply real world data to ensure functionality
3. Updates
	-Upadate features to ensure requirements
	-fix bugs

#Adam Oehmen Comments
Great layout of steps could add more about where we can infomation from
Also can add more for a system overview
