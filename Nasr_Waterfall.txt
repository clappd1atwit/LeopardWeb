Nasr - Waterfall Method
1. Requirements Gathering: The program is feasible to build and it is possible with the given technology.
	-The base class of the system is user:
 		-Attributes: first name, last name, ID
	-The first subclass is student:
		-Students are able to: 
			-search courses 
			-add/drop courses 
			-print their schedule
	-The Instructor subclass:
		-Instructor classes can:
			-print their schedule 
			-print their classlist
			-search for courses.
	-The Admin subclass:
		-Admin classes can:
			-add courses to the system
			-remove coursesfrom the system
			-add/remove users 
			-add/remove student from a course
			-search and print rosters and courses.
	-Database of courses: this will contain information such as:
		-the CRN, course name, times, and instructor
	-The system will also include:
		-multiple semesters, print-out of schedule, scheduling preferences.
	-Requirements validation: 
		-check to see if the requirements are realistic

2. System and software design
	Design only â€“ component, architectural, interface, and database design
	Architectural design 
		-database 
			-One table containing all necessary user info, and a second table for each user to display their schedule
		-functions
			-each class has their own functions listed in step 1
		-classes
			-Student, admin, instructor
		-user interface
			-Login Screen, into menu with given options, different options lead to different 
			images/secondary options
	Interface design 
		attempt a graphical model, simple design with button like selections
	Component design 
		menu layout can be reused in multiple sections
	Database design 
		I beileive one table is sufficent as all useres have the same basic info, 
		the table would contain:
			Columns: ID, name, and user type(admin, instructor, user)
3. Implemetation and Testing
	- Method of testing would be to test indivdual aspects after all of the design stage is complete
4. then integrate together and Test as a unit
5. Operation and Maintenance
	-Enusre everything works properly, if not then debug and fix errors.

#Adam Oehmen Comments
Strong materials and system design sections

Dan Comments:
- Very descirptive System design. It is very explicit on how the code architecture will be designed
- Software Design step is very clear and descriptive
