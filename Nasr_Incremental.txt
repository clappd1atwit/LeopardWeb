#Adam Oehmen Comments
Great layout and description of steps
Could add more about the design requirements
#

Dan Comments:
-Could be more descriptive about the code functionality at each step. Will all functions be implemented? etc.
- Breaking up the steps into smaller steps might allow for more meaningful progress tracking
